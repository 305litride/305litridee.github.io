#  Lectures and Class Material

**Lecture material:** Link coming soon.
This link will point to the GitHub repository featuring all of the class material such as Jupyter Notebooks, scripts, excercises, slides, etc. 

## 1. Reproducibility in Life Science
**Instructor:** [JB Poline](mailto:jean-baptiste.poline@mcgill.ca)

**Objectives**
With this lecture, you will get a general introduction to reproducible - or irreproducible - life sciences. Specifically, you will
* learn what is meant by reproducibility of research results in the life sciences
* undertand the main causes for irreproducible results
* learn the possible collective and individual actions for curbing irreproducibility

**Material**

## 2. Introduction to the Terminal and Bash
**Instructor:** Sebastian Urchs

**Objectives** To follow most of the other modules you will have to have some basic understanding of the command line.
In this module we'll take a look at the the BourneAgainSHell (BASH), 
the default command line in most Linux systems. 
You will learn how to:

* move around on your computer with the command line, create and open directories and files
* find things with the command line (files and programs, PATH variables)
* run useful command line programs and find help (find, grep, ls, and man / documentation)

**Materials**: 
- you can find [the PDF of the slides here](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2021/raw/master/lectures/26-July/03-intro-to-shell/introduction-to-shell.pdf)
- please download and extract into your home directory [these example files](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2021/raw/master/lectures/26-July/03-intro-to-shell/shell-course.zip)

**Pre-recorded lecture video**: Is [available on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Sd10Wo5LQls).

**Pre-recorded lecture video:** coming soon

## 3. Introduction to Git and GitHub
**Instructor:** Kendra Oudyk

**Objectives** Git and GitHub are key tools for doing version control in both academia and industry. These tools can help students do more effient, open, and reproducible research. Further, knowing these tools can help prepare students for careers in academia and industry. In this lecture, students will learn

* What is version control and why has it become so important in science and industry;
* How to track and share their own work using Git and GitHub; and
* How to collaborate and contribute to open projects using Git and GitHub.

## 4. Introduction to Python
**Instructor:** Jacob Sanz-Robinson 

**Objectives**
* This lecture is designed to get students up and running with Python. It is expected that Python 3 (preferably 3.7 or later) is installed, and that the students have some basic previous experience in a scripting language.
* It will guide students through the fundamental syntax, concepts, and data structures required to code in Python 3.
* Topics include: Running your code, commenting, variables, arithmetic, logic, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, libraries, if statements, loops, and exceptions.

## 5. Numpy, Scipy, and Pandas: The Python Toolbox for Data Analyses
**Instructor:** [Tristan Glatard](mailto:tristan.glatard@concordia.ca)

**Objectives**

This lecture will introduce NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy, three of the main libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.
At the end of the lecture, participants will be able to:

* Manipulate arrays of numbers with NumPy
* Manipulate data frames with Pandas
* Apply numerical methods from the scientific Python ecosystem

**Assigned readings** 
* [A Visual Intro to NumPy and Data Representation](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy) by Jay Alammar, **up to "Transposing and Reshaping**.
* [Pandas DataFrame introduction](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html)
* [Pandas read-write tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/02_read_write.html)
* [Scipy introduction](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/general.html)
* [Scipy IO tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/io.html)

## 6. Virtualization of computing environments
**Instructor:** Peer Herholz

* Learn about different virtualization technologies, what they entail and how they work.
* Get first experience with basic utilization.
* Evaluate if, when and how to integrate virtualization into the lifecycle of a project.

**Pre-recorded lecture video:** 

## 7. Tools for project management and organization
**Instructor:** Elizabeth DuPre

Project management and data standards are a vital, if underappreciated, point in any data science workflow.
In this lecture, students will learn common project management and data standards for neuroscience,
as well as how they can incorporate these standards into their own research workflows.
Students will leave with:

* An understanding of the importance of standards in creating reproducible results
* An overview of common data standards for neuroscience and tools to interface with them
* Best practice recommendations for incorporating standards into existing workflows

## 8. High Performance Computing (HPC)
**Instructor:** Bryan Caron & Darcy Quesnel

* Learn the key facts aspects High Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud computing
* Understand the advantages and the constraints of HPC
* Learn the key concepts and practical bash commands to get started on the Compute Canada HPC

**Pre-recorded lecture video:** 

## 9. Introduction to Data Visualization in Python
**Instructor:** Jacob Sanz-Robinson

* This module will teach students the basics of data visualization in Python, with the goal of using it as a tool to understand data, and create publication-quality graphics.
* It will guide students through the process of familiarizing themselves with the data, and choosing plots that display the information accurately and clearly.
* It will provide the students with instructions and examples on how to use multiple widely-used plotting libraries in Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plot.ly, Bokeh).

## 10. Classical statistics pitfalls and remedies.
**Instructor:** [JB Poline](mailto:jean-baptiste.poline@mcgill.ca)

**Objectives**
Most of published results still rely on some statistical inference. With this lecture, you will 
* get a reminder of the classical statistical framework and learn about the issues brought by the use of statistical inference
* learn (or be reminded of) the notion of effect size, power, positive predictive values and the consequences of low powered studies 
* understand the file drawer effect, p-hacking, and know about some solutions.

## 11. Introduction to Machine Learning part 1: supervised learning
**Instructor:** Nikhil Bhagwat

* Understand basic concepts in supervised machine-learning
* Implement a typical model validation pipeline with Scikit-learn
* Learn about various model performance scores and their use-cases

**Pre-recorded lecture video:** 

## 12. Introduction to Machine Learning part 2: dimensionality reduction techniques
**Instructor:** Jérôme Dockès

* Understand the challenges of learning from high-dimensional data
* Learn about tools to mitigate the issue: feature selection and dimensionality reduction
* Train a machine-learning pipeline on fMRI data and evaluate its prediction performance
