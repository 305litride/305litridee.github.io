You will learn how to:

* move around on your computer with the command line, create and open directories and files
* find things with the command line (files and programs, PATH variables)
* run useful command line programs and find help (find, grep, ls, and man / documentation)

**Materials**: 
- you can find [the PDF of the slides here](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2021/raw/master/lectures/26-July/03-intro-to-shell/introduction-to-shell.pdf)

**Material:** Coming soon.

**Pre-recorded lecture video:** Coming soon.

## 4. Introduction to Python
**Instructor:** Jacob Sanz-Robinson 

**Objectives**

* This lecture is designed to get students up and running with Python. It is expected that Python 3 (preferably 3.7 or later) is installed, and that the students have some basic previous experience in a scripting language.
* It will guide students through the fundamental syntax, concepts, and data structures required to code in Python 3.
* Topics include: Running your code, commenting, variables, arithmetic, logic, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, libraries, if statements, loops, exceptions, and classes.
