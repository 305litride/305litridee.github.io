## 1. Reproducibility in Life Science
**Instructor:** JB Poline

**Objectives**
With this lecture, you will get a general introduction to reproducible - or irreproducible - life sciences. Specifically, you will
* learn what is meant by reproducibility of research results in the life sciences
* undertand the main causes for irreproducible results
* learn the possible collective and individual actions for curbing irreproducibility

## 4. Introduction to Python
**Instructor:** Jacob Sanz-Robinson 

**Objectives**
* This lecture is designed to get students up and running with Python. It is expected that Python 3 (preferably 3.7 or later) is installed, and that the students have some basic previous experience in a scripting language.
* It will guide students through the fundamental syntax, concepts, and data structures required to code in Python 3.
* Topics include: Running your code, commenting, variables, arithmetic, logic, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, libraries, if statements, loops, and exceptions.

## 9. Introduction to Data Visualization in Python
**Instructor:** Jacob Sanz-Robinson

* This module will teach students the basics of data visualization in Python, with the goal of understanding their data, and creating publication-quality graphics.
* It will guide students through the process of familiarizing themselves with the data, and choosing plots that display the information accurately and clearly.
* It will provide the students with instructions and examples on how to use multiple widely-used plotting libraries in Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plot.ly, Bokeh).

## 10. Classical statistics: Statistical modeling, common pitfalls, and remedies.
**Instructor:** JB Poline

**Objectives**
Most of published results still rely on some statistical inference. With this lecture, you will 
* get a reminder of the classical statistical framework and learn about the issues brought by the use of statistical inference  
* learn (or be reminded of) the notion of effect size, power, positive predictive values and the consequences of low powered studies 
* understand the file drawer effect, p-hacking, and know about some solutions
