Hi, everyone! I'm Ulyana Dupletsa and I am a graduate student in Theoretical Physics at the University of Milan-Bicocca. After my master's degree I've decided to dedicate my studies to Astrophysics. Now I'm working on a new fascinating project on the evolution of supermassive black holes! You can see more about it on my homepage!
