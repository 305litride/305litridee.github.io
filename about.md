Hi, everyone! I'm Ulyana and I'm studying Theoretical Physics at the University of Milan-Bicocca. I already earned my Bachelor's and now I'm completing my master's project on one of the most mysterious topics: entropy of black holes!

#Black holes have Entropy!

Black holes are the most fascinating objects in the Universe! Regions of spacetime where the gravitational force is so strong to not even let light escape if it passes to close. Yet we do know so little about them.
