Nursing companies and retirement houses need better ways of monitoring their patient’s health signs for a quick and effective emergency response or general diagnosis. When an emergency happens the patient needs fast and responsive treatment, some of which every second is important.

## What is H+?

H+ platform combines multi-patient monitoring with backend clinical services, ensuring that health related events and potential hazards are detected by the systems continuous data analysis.

The System Service comes with an electrocardiogram sensor and aggregator unit bundle created and designed by our company. The sensor will be constantly sending data to our aggregator unit about the user’s vital signs

## Why H+ exist?

By keeping track of the user's vital signs, H+ is able to create a medical diagnostic that lets the caregiver know if the patient is currently suffering from any health related issues, and if so, the emergency services will be immediately contacted and an ambulance will be sent directly to the patient’s location. The health professional/caregiver currently appointed as the patient’s carer will also receive the same diagnostic through his mobile phone so that the patient can have almost instant medical assistance.

### The Sensor:
The sensor is a battery-powered band wearable that sticks to your chest. It is capable of gathering life vital signs: Pulse Rate, Body Temperature and Blood Pressure.
The data gathered by the sensor is sent wirelessly to the aggregator unit.


### The aggregator unit:
A small aggregator unit that collects all the data wirelessly sent by the sensor. On the display it shows the user’s real time vital signs. Through mobile data, all the information that was collected is sent to our main frame, where it is processed by our data analysis servers.

### Carer app:
A mobile application that informs the caregiver/health professional about possible emergencies. When our system detects a possible problem with a patient, this mobile application sends a distress signal to the team of health professionals with the user’s location and issue.

## H+ Highlights

* H+ is capable of monitoring the following several vital signs:
  * Pulse Rate;
  * Body Temperature;
  * Blood pressure;
* H+ gathers and analysis the data of every patient in real time: By keeping track of the user’s vital signs we are able to create a medical diagnostic that lets you know if the patient is * currently suffering from any health related issues;
* Decision making based on personal clinical state: the emergencies services will be immediately contacted and an ambulance  will be directed to the location;
* GPS location monitoring;
* The sensor is connected to the aggregator unit via low power Bluetooth;
* H+ aggregator unit is portable and User-Friendly.

## Technical requirements

* Both the sensor and the aggregator unit have to be functional at all times;
* The sensor has to be within 10m of the aggregator;
* The Carer app must be installed and functional on the caregiver’s/health professional’s smartphone;
* The aggregator must have GSM coverage;
* The client must have a team of health professionals available to respond immediately to emergencies;
* The client must have a team able to apply the wearable to the patients and maintain the system;
* Our data analysis servers must be functional at all times;
* The system must be provided with an updated medical sheet of each patient for accurate results.

## Risk and Challenges

We believe H+ will make a difference on people’s health and how clinical services are managed. Just like any other project, we may face challenges when it comes to engineering, manufacturing and shipping.
H+ must be tested and approved in order to obtain the CE Mark.
Although we are aware that there are already technological devices capable of gathering the user’s vital signs, we are working on a solution that will enable us to provide superior quality and a more affordable solution.
Our goal, as mentioned above, is to deliver an affordable solution to a rather expensive market. With that in mind, we will work in order to keep the product’s retail price as low as possible without compromising it’s reliability and quality.
