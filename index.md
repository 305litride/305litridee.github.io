## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a web platform hosting a chatbot that offers users comprehensive mental health support. We create a relaxed and open conversational environment for users to share experiences and feelings. By integrating psychological counseling, assessment and diagnosis, we aim to establish a close relationship of trust and understanding with users. Leveraging technological advantages, we can understand users' personality, personal experiences, and emotional states, offering a private, warm, secure, timely, and empathetic conversational space. As a mental health support chatbot, our platform provides emotional support and psychological guidance through conversations with users from the perspective of a professional counselor.
