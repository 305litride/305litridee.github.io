# Project 1 : Fraud detectetion

World-Leading Risk Intelligence and Device Fingerprinting Technology

The Global Standard for Device Identification
The SHIELD platform is born of a revolutionary approach to device identification that empowers businesses to accurately identify every single device on their ecosystem with unparalleled persistence.

Exposing Every Malicious Tool and Technique
Bolstered by extensive research into fraud attacks and methodologies we profile across the globe, our technology observes device attributes and running processes to identify any tools in use that are typically associated with fraud.

Identify the Exact Moment a Good User Turns Bad
SHIELD Sentinel is the only technology in the world that continuously profiles risk across the user session. In doing so, it gives mobile apps the unique ability to identify the exact moment a user begins exhibiting malicious behavior.

## project 2 : Cartoonify Image with Machine Learning
Project Idea: Transform images into its cartoon. Yes, the objective of this machine learning project is to CARTOONIFY the images.

Thus, you will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using machine learning libraries.

### Project 3 : Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

Project idea – The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take.

It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. You can build a linear model for this project

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
