# Black Holes have Entropy!

Black holes are the most fascinating objects in the Universe! Regions of spacetime where the gravitational force is so strong to not even let light can escape if it passes too close. Yet we do know so little about them. Often they are refered to as singularities meaning that a coordinate-independent quantity, the curvature, which measures the strenght of gravitational pull, becomes infinite and our physics fails to describe what's inside a black hole. Everything seems shielded by a horizon and it is sensible to require that there are no singularities without a horizon. 

There is a theorem - the no-hair theorem - stating that all the accessible information about a black hole is its mass, its charge, if it has one, and its angular momentum if it's rotating. It was an extraordinary breakthrough to find out that black holes behave as thermodynamic objects: they possess a temperature, emit radiation and, on top, they have entropy.

The discovery of the concept of black hole entropy goes to Jacob Bekenstein. Here is an extract from an article by Thibault Damour, which you can find at the following link [Damour](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0401160.pdf) and which is a good introduction to the thermodynamic aspects of black holes. Damour takes it from John Wheeler's book **A journey into gravity and spacetime** and it is John Wheeler, who's speaking.

> One afternoon in 1970 Bekenstein -then a graduate student- and I were discussing black hole physics in my office in Princeton's Jadwin Hall. I told him the concern I always feel when a hot cup of tea exchanges heat energy with a cold cup of tea. By allowing that transfer of heat I do not alter the energy of the universe, but I do increase its microscopic disorder, its information loss, its entropy. The entropy of the world always increases in an irreversible process like that.

> *The consequence of my crime, Jacob, would echo down to the end of time,* I noted. *But if a black hole swims by, and I drop the teacups into it, I conceal from all the world the evidence of my crime. How remarkable!*

> *You don't destroy entropy when you drop those teacups into the black hole. The black hole already has entropy, and you only increase it!*
