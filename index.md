# Stock Prices Predictor

One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on Machine Learning projects for students is working on Stock Prices Predictor. Business organizations and companies today are on the lookout for software that can monitor and analyze the company performance and predict future prices of various stocks. And with so much data available on the stock market, it is a hotbed of opportunities for data scientists with an inclination for finance.

## SportsPredictor

In Michael Lewis’ Moneyball, the Oakland Athletics team transformed the face of baseball by incorporating analytical player scouting technique in their gameplan. And just like them, you too can revolutionize sports in the real world! This is an excellent machine learning projects for beginners.

Since there is no dearth of data in the sports world, you can utilize this data to build fun and creative machine learning projects such as using college sports stats to predict which player would have the best career in which particular sports (talent scouting). You could also opt for enhancing team management by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the players in a team and classifying them accordingly.

### Develop A Sentiment Analyzer

This is one of the interesting machine learning project ideas. Although most of us use social media platforms to convey our personal feelings and opinions for the world to see, one of the biggest challenges lies in understanding the ‘sentiments’ behind social media posts.


#### Movie Ticket Pricing System

With the expansion of OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, people prefer to watch content as per their convenience. Factors like Pricing, Content Quality & Marketing have influenced the success of these platforms.

The cost of making a full-length movie has shot up exponentially in the recent past. Only 10% of the movies that are made make profits. Stiff competition from Television & OTT platforms along with the high ticket cost has made it difficult for films to make money even harder. The rising cost of the theatre ticket (along with the popcorn cost) leaves the cinema hall empty.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
