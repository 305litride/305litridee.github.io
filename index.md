# QLSC 612 - Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science

<img src="logo_horizontal__for_light_background.png" alt="drawing" width="250" class="center">

## Course overview:

Neuroscientists increasingly rely on openly-accessible data and on advanced methodological procedures for their investigations. Data science offers a key set of tools and methods to efficiently analyse, visualize, and interpret neuroscience data. Concurrently, there is a growing concern in the life sciences that many results produced are difficult or even impossible to reproduce, commonly referred to as the “reproducibility crisis.”

This course — QLSC-612, [Fundamentals for Neuro Data Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/qlsc-612) — brings together software and analytical tools and methods in order to teach students how to best use the fundamentals of data science in their daily work to produce reproducible results. We will take examples in neuroimaging and see how to use computational tools, statistical and machine learning techniques, and collaborative, open science methodologies to generate results that are statistically robust and computationally reproducible. The course also serves as the first week of the [Montreal BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/) organized across Université de Montréal, McGill, Concordia and Polytechnique.

## Objective, scope, and intended audience

QLSC-612 is intended for researchers in the life sciences (neurologists, psychiatrists, pyschologists, neuroscientists) who wish to improve their research practices, or other researchers who want an introduction to data science with examples in neuroscience and neuroimaging. At the end of the course students will be able to analyze neuroscience and neuroimaging data in a reproducible and collaborative manner using the Python software stack (a popular and rapidly growing contender in the landscape of neuroscience data analysis).

Amongst the topics, we will cover both the fundamentals of tools (bash, git, github, jupyter, docker, visualization) and analysis methods (hypothesis testing, machine learning) at the conceptual and practical levels.

In terms of requirements, students will be expected to have basic programming skills (such as minimal experience in a scripting language).

## Course modules:

1. Reproducibility in Life Science
2. Introduction to the Terminal and Bash
3. Introduction to Git and GitHub
4. Introduction to Python
5. Numpy, Scipy, and Pandas: The Python Toolbox for Data Analyses
6. Introduction to virtual environments and containers
7. Tools for project management and organization
8. High Performance Computing (HPC)
9. Introduction to Data Visualization
10. Classical statistics: Statistical modeling, common pitfalls, and remedies.
11. Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
12. Advanced Machine Learning with Neuroimaging and Nilearn

## Approach to teaching

This year, we will be using an "inverted classroom" approach. Students will be able to pick 8 of the modules from the list above, and will be able to access pre-recorded lecture or online material to learn the contents of the modules. There will be quizzes and online live tutorials to answer questions and go through exercises in order to solidify the knowledge and help prepare the students for their assessment.
